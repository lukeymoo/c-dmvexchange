DMV Exchange ported to C++ ( NEED MOARRR POWERRR )


<h1>Basic info</h1>
<p>
	Im using a framework called CppCMS which provides all the functions to have a working
	website.
</p>
<p>
	The web templates work by being skinned, then compiled into object files `.o` which
	is then dynamically ( still statically linked as of may. 27 ) linked to the application.
</p>
<h2>Why use C++? Are you dumb ?</h2>
<p>
	Negative.
	<br>
	As I think more and more into the future I realize I'm either going to need lots of revenue or extremely efficient software & the only thing I can really control right now
	is software efficiency.
	<br>
	DMV Exchange is not always going to be DMV Exchange, the current state of the group is to provide a way to aggregate similar people ( People who like to buy, sell and trade shoes ).
	<br>
	The aggregation of these people will make it much easier to roll out the true products of the group.
	<br>
	<strong>Automation</strong>
	<br>
	The ultimate goal is create a group|business that essentially runs itself. Culling bad products/posts through a voting/review system
	<br>
	Curating relevant products to people through neural networking.
	<br>
	And a safe and rapid transit between users through the use of automated drones & built-in escrow system.
	<br>
	Unfortunately this technology is currently held back by primitive batteries & lagging regulation by the FAA to keep up with the future.
	The good side is that most drone tech is still in it's infancy and even if regulation allowed, they wouldn't be safe to enter the market.
	<br>
	Probably the most important reason is simply to develop my abilities and understanding of tech.
	Theres something deeply interesting in being able to bring ideas to the real world & being a part of what is deemed innovation.
